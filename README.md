# About

<p> I'm a data-driven problem solver with a passion for software and data engineering. As an undergraduate Computer Science major at the University of Maryland, I've developed a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and database systems. I'm also proficient in Python, Scala, SQL, Cloud Services, and Spark.

I'm always looking for new ways to use data to solve complex problems and create efficient, scalable software solutions. I'm also passionate about sharing my knowledge and experience with others. If you're interested in collaborating on a project or discussing the evolving tech landscape, feel free to reach out.  </p>
