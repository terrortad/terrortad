# About

<p> I'm a data-driven problem solver with a passion for software and data engineering. As an undergraduate Computer Science major at the University of Maryland, I've developed a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and database systems. I'm also proficient in Python, Scala, SQL, Cloud Services, and Spark.

I'm always looking for new ways to use data to solve complex problems and create efficient, scalable software solutions. I'm also passionate about sharing my knowledge and experience with others. If you're interested in collaborating on a project or discussing the evolving tech landscape, feel free to reach out.  </p>

# PROJECTS

## ETL Candy 

<p><b>✔ Associated with University of Maryland (Jan 2023 - Jun 2023 ) </b>


I recently collaborated with a team of 6 students to develop an ETL code sequence that merged three years' worth of product order data into a new data mart. We worked with data from 2017 to 2019, understanding the variations and successfully creating SQL code to scrub and import the data into a unified staging table.

This project enhanced my skills in SQL and data analysis while emphasizing the importance of teamwork in solving complex problems. We had to work together to understand the data, identify the variations, and create a solution that would work for all three years of data.

The project was a valuable opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world scenario. We learned how to use SQL to extract, transform, and load data, and we also learned how to work effectively as a team.I recently collaborated with a team of 6 students to develop an ETL code sequence that merged three years' worth of product order data into a new data mart.

## Real-time Data Pipeline Development using Apache Pulsar and Python 

<p><b>✔ Apr 2023 - Jun 2023</b>

I created a real-time data pipeline that streams, processes, and analyzes live data from the Yelp API. I used Apache Pulsar and Python to build the pipeline, and I made iterative changes to the code on GitHub using incremental commits.

The pipeline is scalable and resilient, and it can handle large amounts of data without breaking down. I used Python's versatile libraries to transform and process the Yelp data, and I developed complex data flow channels that provide quick insights and analytics.

The project was a great learning experience, and it gave me the opportunity to use my skills in software engineering, data engineering, and machine learning. I'm proud of the work I did, and I'm confident that the pipeline will be a valuable asset to any organization that uses it.

## Cloud-Based Data Pipeline with Azure Data Factory

<p><b>✔ Mar 2023 - Apr 2023 </b>

I built a cloud-based data pipeline using Azure Data Factory that extracts, converts, and loads (ETL) data from diverse sources into a single data warehouse. This allows for more efficient analysis and real-time insights.

As well, I used Azure Data Factory's automation and orchestration capabilities to build a scalable and effective data management solution. The project was an eye-opening experience that greatly expanded my knowledge of cloud computing and data integration technologies.
